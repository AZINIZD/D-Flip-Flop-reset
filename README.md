This repository contains an implementation of a D-Flip Flop with an asynchronous reset feature. A D-Flip Flop is a type of digital storage element that captures the value of the input data (D) at the rising edge of the clock (CLK) signal. The asynchronous reset allows the flip-flop to reset its output (Q) to a known state regardless of the clock signal.
